# Semi-Dense Feature Matching

Precise GIS layers are essential for smart-city services and autonomous navigation. However, pedestrian-level assets such as sidewalks and vegetation buffers remain poorly mapped in most urban databases. AI-generated imagery offers a way to complement these datasets, but only if its synthesised views can be accurately aligned. To address this challenge, we introduce a feature-to-feature knowledge distillation (KD) framework that produces an ultra-lightweight neural network (student) capable of extracting semi-dense features from images. These features yield semantically rich keypoint correspondences that support translation, rotation, and scale restoration. The framework distils geometric expertise from a high-capacity teacher into a compact student, built on a Mamba model. Our evaluation focuses on aligning GIS features, covering roads, sidewalks, buildings, and vegetation. The KD-Mamba matcher boosts alignment accuracy and reaches an 86% post-correction similarity rate. The proposed method outperforms classical feature-based baselines, SIFT and ORB, by a wide margin (around 12%). Compared with state-of-the-art deep homography estimators, it achieves similar precision while cutting computational cost by 40%. These gains stem from the modelâ€™s ability to capture long-range geometric dependencies with O(N ) complexity. By tightening the spatial registration of AI-generated imagery, our approach enables the reliable fusion of street-level, aerial, and satellite data into coherent pedestrian GIS layers. This paves the way for high-fidelity maps that support next-generation urban applications.
